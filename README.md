Github project participation activity analysis and contributor profile building

## Overview

Discover who is contributing to the projects of interest and describe contribution activity at the contributor level. How are different organizations represented among the contributor base? Additionally, we would like to identify if contributors are university students or individuals not already associated with a major organization.

The Github API code comes from the BonnyCI project: https://github.com/BonnyCI/shuffleboard

## Roadmap

Project status: https://github.com/BonnyCI/mateys-ahoy/projects/1

Initial exploratory analysis has been done resources from the BonnyCI/ci-plunder project. The analysis will start by determining metrics for measuring contributor participation and then move towards building more complete profiles for these contributors beyond their Github profiles. The final deliverable will be a hosted web application that provides visual data plots of interest based on regular updates of the contributor data archive.

### Milestone 1: Participation Metrics

* How are people participating in the projects?
* How does frequency of activity compare between contributors?
* Are there other types of activity with lower frequencies that may indicate a stronger involvement?
* What are the characteristics of the most involved (and/or influential) contributors?
* Can we quantify involvement? Can we quantify influence?

### Milestone 2: Contributor Profiles

Discover data beyond Github profiles for project contributors. This may involve additional searches using social network profile tools or search engines. Explore the combinations of parameters sufficient for a high probability match. Human review will likely be needed on any results here as we work to improve this.

* Who is contributing to the projects?
* Who do they work for? Are they students?

### Milestone 3: Contributor Archive

Store data gathered in Milestone 2 (and keep history intact).

### Milestone 4: Dashboard

Focus on building and deploying the final deliverable.

### Milestone 5: Leverage AI

Iterations on the Milestones listed above to improve our matching and participation analysis using AI.
